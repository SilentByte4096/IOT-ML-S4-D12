# Modulation Classification using Machine Learning  

This project classifies different modulation types (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM) using machine learning techniques.  
It extracts features from SDR (Software Defined Radio) signals, trains a model, and evaluates performance.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Generates simulated signals for different modulations  
- Extracts key features from signal data  
- Preprocesses data for training  
- Trains a machine learning model  
- Evaluates and tests model performance  
- Visualizes classification results  

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure  
- `1_signal_generation.py` - Generates synthetic modulated signals  
- `2_feature_extraction.py` - Extracts signal features  
- `3_preprocess.py` - Prepares features for training  
- `4_train_model.py` - Trains a classifier  
- `5_test.py` - Tests the trained model  
- `6_visualize.py` - Plots classification results  
- `7_verify.py` - Verifies predictions and calculates accuracy  
- `run_all.sh` - Automates the process  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The project works with synthetic signal data saved in CSV format:  
- `features.csv` - Extracted features from signals  
- `processed_features.csv` - Normalized features for training  
- `classified_results.csv` - Model predictions
